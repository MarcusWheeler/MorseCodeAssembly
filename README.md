# MorseCodeAssembly
Relative Jumps in AVR assembly have a maximum of 64 lines of offset, so I had to work around that a little bit.
There are essentially checkpoints in my code that the Program Counter jumps to in order to reach a farther jump.
In addition, a binary search could have worked if I had time to complete it and would have possibly saved lines.
